# MeowMonitor
This is the repository for the MeowMonitor chrome extension. The MeowMonitor chrome extension monitors any camera that you view on the meow.camera website and notifies you when there is movement on said camera by playing a beeping noise. The extension works in the background so you can do something else while waiting for a kitty to show up at the feeder. You can also open multiple instances of the meow.camera website to monitor multiple cameras at once.

You can find the newest version of the chrome extension [here](https://github.com/Memez4Life7/MeowMonitor/releases/tag/v1.0.0).

Or you can download it from the chrome web store here: PENDING REVIEW.
